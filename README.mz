# Stops Timetables

Make it easier to create printable HTML timetables for public transport.

Generate the html file and open in a browser.

```bash bash
./bin.mjs > index.html
```

## Roadmap

- Use semantically correct HTML.
- Move the data out into a JSON file.
- Create a nicer cli experience with usage docs.
- Support using the timetables in webpages.
